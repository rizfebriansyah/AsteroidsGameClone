# AsteroidsGameClone
 To create a clone of the famous Space Invaders game, where the user controls a rocket ship and takes down asteroids in space, with realistic movement, gravity and collision checks.  

The orange triangle represents the **rocket ship.**  
Grey circles of various sizes falling from the sky represents the **asteroids.**  
The blue area situated at the very bottom of the game represents **Earth.**  
The translucent grey area below represents the **gravity field.** Falling into this gravity field will render the rocket ship to be uncontrollable and crash into Earth.  

To play the game: 
- Use arrow keys to move the rocket ship around
- Press spacebar to shoot the asteroids 

Your game will be *over* if your rocket ship hits an asteroid or falls into the gravity field.
